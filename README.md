Wastewater Treatment Evaluation Project
Overview
This project aims to evaluate global wastewater treatment practices using data from the Environmental Performance Index (EPI). The dataset spans from 1995 to 2022 and covers 220 countries, providing insights into trends and performance in wastewater treatment over time.

Features
>Connect to Azure Blob Storage to access the dataset.
>Perform basic data analysis using Pandas in JupyterLab.
>Generate summary statistics and visualize trends in wastewater treatment practices.

Installation:

1. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   !pip install azure-storage-blob
   !pip install python-dotenv
   !pip install pandas

2. Upload the .env file containing Azure Blob Storage credentials to your project folder in JupyterLab.
3. Load the .env file and necessary modules in your JupyterLab notebook.

Usage
>Open the JupyterLab notebook Wastewater_Treatment_Analysis.ipynb.
>Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to connect to Azure Blob Storage and analyze the dataset.
>Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and perform data analysis tasks.

Contents
>Wastewater_Treatment_Analysis.ipynb: JupyterLab notebook containing the analysis code and documentation.
>azure_credentials.env: Environment variables file containing Azure Blob Storage credentials.
